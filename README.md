# About project

This is a pizza ordering app, where you can order pizza without creating accounts. You just enter your name, then you can order

as many pizza as you can afford. There is no problem if you suddenly close the app, open again and see that your data is still here.

However, don't logout, because you will really lose all your orders.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
